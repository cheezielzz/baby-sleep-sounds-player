A simple project that plays soothing audio tracks to help your little one relax, sleep, and feel secure.

# About
Foundation built by v0 and later on refined further by me. I built this project as a testing ground to review the practicality and performance of using a v0 app for public applications + I wanted to try this out with my newborn nephew.

This is just an initial build and I plan to add on more features to make this a companion app for parents who are managing their newborns.

If you enjoy using it or you wish to provide feedbacks/feature requests, please feel free to open up an issue and I will respond when available.
